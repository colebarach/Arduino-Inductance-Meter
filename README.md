# Arduino Inductance Meter
An inductance meter for the arduino microcontroller
## Usage
Connect an inductor in parallel with a capacitor to form a LC circuit. The input to this circuit will be the Wave Pin, which will stimulate the circuit at a variable frequency, the frecuency at which the inductor's voltage is highest indicates its inductance.
## Notes
This circuit is not designed for accuracy. This project is mainly for personal use.
